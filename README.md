# Base Docker image for JBoss community projects

This repository contains base image that is used to build the portfolio of Docker images for JBoss community projects. 

## Base image

This image is used as a base image for *all* JBoss community images. It provides a base layer that includes:

1. A `jboss` user (uid/gid `1000`) with home directory set to `/opt/jboss`
2. A few tools that may be useful when extending the image or installing software, like `unzip`.

### Operating system

This image uses CentOS 7.

### Working directory

This image has the working directory set to `/opt/jboss`, which is the `jboss` user home directory at the same time.

### Availability

The `Dockerfile` is available in the `master` branch and is built in the Docker HUB as `jboss/base:latest`.

### ACL Limitations

The file acls used, will not work on file systems that do not support them, such as AUFS.
Also, please ensure that your kernel has ACLs enabled (most standard distros should have this by default)
